Traditional snake game involves the walls to be the limit, while growing up I used to play the snake game where the walls act as a portal to the other side.
Small aforementioned tweaks to the algorithm improves the chromosomes and the fitness function.

# Training-Snake-Game-Using-Genetic-Algorithm

main.py -  to start training snake game using genetic algorithm

Snake_Game.py  -  contains logic of creating snake game using pygame

Run_Game.py  -  play snake game using predicted directions from genetic algorithm

Genetic_Algorithm.py  -  contains genetic algorithm functions like crossover, mutation etc

Feed_Forward_Neural_Network.py  -  contains the functions for calculating the output from feed forward neural network
